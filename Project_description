Developing a valuable software for customers is crucial. The software is designed to provide expert-level guidance on outfit selection and suggest purchasing options from online stores. It is also capable of accessing your wardrobe based on your location, creating pop-ups for outfit suggestions, and even setting a schedule for wearing specific types of clothes on different days of the week. The app is interactive and seeks feedback to continuously improve its performance.

The software is aimed at working seamlessly with your wardrobe, allowing you to input your entire collection or select specific items for various occasions. Moreover, it analyzes your outfit usage and recommends which items to wear based on your preferences. However, the development process has faced challenges due to limited resources in terms of database, AI, and machine learning models. Despite these obstacles, we are committed to obtaining the necessary resources and knowledge to bring this project to completion.

While progress has been slowed by resource constraints, the team remains dedicated to the app's full development. The system's interactive nature, ability to analyze preferences, and adapt to user feedback make it a promising and personalized solution for outfit selection and wardrobe management.However, the development process has faced challenges due to limited resources in terms of database, AI, and machine learning models.
