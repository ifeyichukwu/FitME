Make sure to provide customers with value for their money. This software can learn from experts and teach customers about outfit selection. It can also suggest purchasing accessories, clothes, or shoes from online stores. If you have clothes in different locations, you can input this into the app, and it will access your wardrobe based on your location. Additionally, when browsing an online store, the software can create pop-ups suggesting outfits that certain items would go well with and, based on your preference, you could choose to buy such accessories. The software should work with your wardrobe, allowing you to input your entire collection or select specific items for different occasions, such as work, school, or casual outings. It can also analyze your outfit usage to determine which items you wear frequently and recommend when to wear certain items. Furthermore, the app can be set with a schedule for wearing specific types of clothes on different days of the week. It will also ask for feedback in a friendly and interactive manner to learn about your preferences. The system can also prompt you to take pictures of your outfits to improve its matching accuracy. However, due to limited resources in terms of database, AI, and machine learning models, it's been challenging to fully develop the app. We are dedicated to obtaining the necessary resources and knowledge to complete the project.
